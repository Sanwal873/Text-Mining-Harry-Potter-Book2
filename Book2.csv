Harry,Hedwig,"I can't, Hedwig. I'm not allowed 
 to use magic outside of school. 
 Besides, if Uncle Vernon -- "
Uncle Vernon,Harry,Har-ry Pot-ter!
Harry,Hedwig,Now you've done it.
Uncle Vernon,Harry,"I warned you. If you can't 
 control that bloody bird, it'll 
 have to go"
Harry,Uncle Vernon,"She's bored. If I could just let 
 her out for an hour or two --"
Uncle Vernon,Harry,"And have you sending secret 
 messages to your freaky little 
 friends? No, sir."
Harry,Uncle Vernon,"But I haven't gotten any messages.
 From any of my friends. Not one.
 All summer."
Dudley,Harry,Who'd want to be friends with you?
Uncle Vernon,Harry,"I should think you'd be more 
 grateful. We raise you since you 
 were a baby, give you food off our 
 table, even let you have Dudley's 
 second bedroom... purely out of 
 the goodness of our hearts."
Dudley,Uncle Vernon,"I thought he got the second 
 bedroom because Mum was afraid 
 he'd turn us into dung beetles if 
 you put him back in the cupboard 
 under the stairs. 
"
Aunt Petunia,Dudley,"Not yet, popkin. That's for when 
 the Masons arrive."
Uncle Vernon,Aunt Petunia,"Which should be any moment. Now. 
 Let's run through our schedule one 
 more time. Petunia, when the 
 Masons get here, you will be --"
Aunt Petunia,Uncle Vernon,"In the lounge, waiting to welcome 
 them graciously to our home."
Uncle Vernon,Dudley,Good. And Dudley?
Dudley,Uncle Vernon,I'll be waiting to open the door.
Uncle Vernon,Dudley,Excellent. 
Uncle Vernon,Harry,And you
Harry,Uncle Vernon,"I'll be in my bedroom, making no 
 noise and pretending I don't 
 exist."
Uncle Vernon,Harry,"Too right you will. With any 
 luck, this could well be the day I 
 make the biggest deal of my 
 career. "
Uncle Vernon,Harry,Upstairs! Hurry!
Dobby,Harry,"Harry Potter! Such an honor it 
 is!"
Harry,Dobby,What... Who are you?
Dobby,Harry,"Dobby, sir. Dobby the house elf"
Harry,Dobby,"I see. Not to be rude or 
 anything, but this isn't a great 
 time for me to have a house-elf in 
 my bedroom."
Dobby,Harry,"Oh, yes, sir, Dobby understands. 
 It's just that, Dobby has come to 
 tell you... it is difficult, sir... 
 Dobby wonders where to begin."
Harry,Dobby,Why don't you sit down?
Dobby,Harry,S-s-sit down? 
Harry,Dobby,"Shhhh! I'm sorry. I didn't mean 
 to offend you or anything --"
Dobby,Harry,"Offend Dobby! Dobby has heard of 
 your greatness, sir, but never has 
 he been asked to sit down by a 
 wizard, like an equal..."
Harry,Dobby,"You can't have met many decent 
 wizards then"
Dobby,Dobby,Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
Uncle Vernon,Mr. Mason,"Don't mind that. It's just the... 
 cat."
Dudley,Uncle Vernon,Cat? What cat?
Uncle Vernon,Dudley,"Our cat, tiger."
Harry,Dobby,Are you... all right?
Dobby,Harry,"DOBBY, sir. Dobby the house elf"
Harry,Dobby,Your... family?
Dobby,Harry,"The wizard family Dobby serves, 
 sir. Dobby is bound to serve one 
 family forever. If they ever knew 
 Dobby was here... 
"
Dobby,Harry,"But Dobby had to come. Dobby has 
 to protect Harry Potter. To warn 
 him. 

 Harry Potter must not go back to 
 Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and 
 Wizardry this year."
Harry,Dobby,Not go back? But... I have to.
Dobby,Harry,"This is a plot. A plot to make 
 most terrible things happen. If 
 Harry Potter goes back to school 
 he will be in great danger."
Harry,Dobby,"What terrible things? Who's 
 plotting them?"
Harry,Dobby,"Okay! I understand. You can't 
 say -- 
"
Uncle Vernon,Mr. Mason,"They arrive at the ninth hole 
 and -- 
"
Mr. Mason,Uncle Vernon,"Sounds as if that cat of yours has 
 dragged something in with it, 
 Dursley."
Uncle Vernon,Mr. Mason,Not to worry. I'll sort it out.
Harry,Dobby,Stop! Stop! 
Uncle Vernon,Harry,"What the devil are you doing up 
 here! You've just ruined the 
 punch line of my Japanese golfer 
 joke. One more sound and you'll 
 wish you'd never been born, boy!"
Harry,Dobby,"See why I've got to go back? I 
 don't belong here. I belong in 
 your world -- at Hogwarts. It's 
 the only place I've got... 
 friends."
Dobby,Harry,"Friends who don't even write to 
 Harry Potter?"
Harry,Dobby,"Well, I expect they've been -- 
 hang on, how do you know my 
 friends haven't been writing me? "
Dobby,Harry,"Harry Potter mustn't be angry with 
 Dobby -- Dobby hoped if Harry 
 Potter thought his friends had 
 forgotten him... Harry Potter 
 might not want to go back to 
 school, sir..."
Harry,Dobby,Give me those. Now. 
Harry,Dobby,Dobby... Please... No...
Dobby,Harry,"Harry Potter must say he's not 
 going back to school."
Harry,Dobby,I can't. Hogwarts is my home.
Dobby,Harry,"Then Dobby must do it, sir. For 
 Harry Potter's own good. 
"
Uncle Vernon,Mr. Mason,"I'm sorry. It's our nephew. Very 
 disturbed. Meeting strangers 
 upsets him, so we kept him 
 upstairs..."
Aunt Petunia,Mr. Mason,"We have ice cream... 
"
Uncle Vernon,Harry,Go on. Read it.
Harry,Uncle Vernon,"Dear Mr. Potter. We have 
 received intelligence that a Hover 
 Charm was used at your place of 
 residence at twelve minutes past 
 seven this evening. As you know, 
 underage wizards...'"
Uncle Vernon,Harry,"... are not permitted to perform
 spells outside school.'

 You didn't tell us you weren't 
 Allowed to use magic at home. 
 Slipped your mind, didn't it?"
Uncle Vernon,Harry,"Well, I've got news for you, boy. 
 I'm locking you up! And if you 
 try to magic yourself out, they'll 
 expel you! You're never going 
 back to that school! Never!"
Dudley,Harry,I know what day it is.
Harry,Dudley,"Well done, Dudley. Finally 
 learned the days of the week, have 
 you"
Dudley,Harry,"Today's your birthday. And nobody 
 cares. 
"
Harry,Hedwig,"It's no good turning your beak up. 
 It's all we've got. 
"
Harry,Ron,Ron?
Ron,Harry,"Hiya, Harry."
Harry,Ron,"Fred? George? What're you doing 
 here?"
Ron,Harry,"Rescuing you, of course. Where's 
 your trunk?"
Ron,Harry,Stand back. 
Harry,Hedwig,Hedwig! 
Uncle Vernon,Aunt Petunia,Petunia! He's getting away! 
Ron,Harry,"Hold on, Harry!"
Uncle Vernon,Harry,"Oh no, boy! You and that bloody 
 pigeon aren't going anywhere! "
Ron,Fred,"Put your foot down, Fred."
Ron,Harry,"By the way, Harry. Happy 
 Birthday."
Fred,Ron,"Hurry! Let's nip inside before 
 Mum wakes up!"
Ron,Harry,It's not much.
Harry,Ron,I think it's... brilliant! 
Mrs. Weasley,Ron,WHERE... HAVE... YOU... BEEN?!
Mrs. Weasley,Harry,"Harry! How wonderful to see you. 
"
Mrs. Weasley,Ron,Beds empty! No note! You could've died! You could've been seen!
Mrs. Weasley,Fred,Beds empty! No note! You could've died! You could've been seen!
Mrs. Weasley,George,Beds empty! No note! You could've died! You could've been seen!
Mrs. Weasley,Harry,"I don't blame you, of course, dear."
Ron,Mrs. Weasley,"They were starving him, Mum! 
 There were bars on his window!"
Mrs. Weasley,Ron,"You best hope I don't put bars on 
 your window, Ronald Weasley! "
Mrs. Weasley,Harry,"Care for a spot of tea, Harry?"
Ginny,Mrs. Weasley,Mummy. Have you seen my jumper -- 
Ron,Harry,"Ginny. Been talking about you all 
 summer. Dead annoying, really."
George,Mrs. Weasley,Dad's home! 
Mr. Weasley,Mrs. Weasley,What a night! Nine raids! Nine!
Harry,Ron,Raids?
Ron,Harry,"Dad works at the Ministry of 
 Magic. In the Misuse of Muggle 
 Artefacts Office"
Harry,Ron,The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts...?
Ron,Harry,"That's when wizards bewitch 
 something to drive Muggles mad. 
 Shrinking door keys, that kind of 
 thing. Dad loves Muggles. Thinks 
 they're fascinating. "
Mr. Weasley,Harry,Well now. Who are you?
Ron,Mr. Weasley,"Harry, sir. Harry Potter."
Mr. Weasley,Harry,"Good Lord, are you really? Ron's 
 told us all about you, of course. 
 When did you get here?"
Mrs. Weasley,Mr. Weasley," This morning. Your sons flew that 
 enchanted car of yours to Surrey 
 house and back last night."
Mr. Weasley,Ron,"Did you now! How'd it go?!  I... I mean... That was very wrong, boys. Very wrong indeed."
Mr. Weasley,Fred,"Did you now! How'd it go?!  I... I mean... That was very wrong, boys. Very wrong indeed."
Mr. Weasley,George,"Did you now! How'd it go?!  I... I mean... That was very wrong, boys. Very wrong indeed."
Mr. Weasley,Harry,"So, Harry. You must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a parking meter?"
Mrs. Weasley,George,"That must be Errol with the post. 
 Fetch him, will you, George? "
George,Mrs. Weasley,"It's our Hogwarts letters! And 
 look. They've sent Harry's as well."
Mrs. Weasley,Harry,"Dumbledore must know you're here, 
 Harry. Doesn't miss a trick, that 
 man."
Fred,Mrs. Weasley,"This lot won't come cheap, Mum. 
 The spellbooks alone..."
Mrs. Weasley,Fred,"We'll manage. Right then. 
 There's only one place to get all 
 of this."
Mrs. Weasley,Harry,"You first, Harry dear. "
Ron,Mrs. Weasley,"Harry's never traveled by Floo 
 Powder before, Mum. "
Harry,Ron,Floo Powder? 
Mrs. Weasley,Percy,"Percy. Would you mind going
 first, so Harry can see how it's
 done?"
Percy,Mrs. Weasley,"Certainly, Mother. "
Percy,Harry,"Don't worry, Harry. It's simple enough."
Percy,Harry,Diagon Alley. 
Mrs. Weasley,Harry,"Remember to speak clearly, dear!"
Ron,Harry,And mind you get out at the right grate!
Harry,Ron, D-Dia-gon Alley!
Harry,Mrs. Weasley, D-Dia-gon Alley!
Mr. Borgin,Lucius Malfoy,"Mr. Malfoy! What a pleasure to 
 see you again. If I may, just in 
 today --"
Lucius Malfoy,Mr. Borgin,"I'm not buying today, Mr. Borgin. 
 But selling."
Mr. Borgin,Lucius Malfoy,Selling?
Lucius Malfoy,Mr. Borgin,"You have heard, of course, that 
 the Ministry of Magic is 
 conducting more raids. There are 
 even rumors of a new Muggle 
 Protection Act... "
Lucius Malfoy,Mr. Borgin,"I have a few... ah... items at 
 home that might prove embarrassing 
 if the Ministry were to call. 
 Certain poisons and the like..."
Mr. Borgin,Lucius Malfoy,Hmmm... yes. I see... 
Draco,Mr. Borgin,Can I have this?
Mr. Borgin,Lucius Malfoy,"Ah, the Hand of Glory. Insert a 
 candle and it gives light only to 
 the holder. Best friend of 
 thieves and plunderers. Your son 
 has fine taste, sir."
Lucius Malfoy,Mr. Borgin,"Hopefully my son will amount to
 more than a thief, Mr. Borgin.
 Though if his marks don't pick
 up --"
Draco,Lucius Malfoy,"It's not my fault the teachers 
 have favorites. That Hermione 
 Granger --"
Lucius Malfoy,Draco,"I would have thought you'd be 
 ashamed that a girl of no 
 wizarding family beat you in every 
 exam."
Mr. Borgin,Lucius Malfoy,"It's the same all over. Wizard 
 blood is counting for less 
 everywhere."
Lucius Malfoy,Mr. Borgin,Not with me. 
Lucius Malfoy,Mr. Borgin,"Very good. I'll expect you at the 
 manor tomorrow. "
Lucius Malfoy,Draco,"Come, Draco."
Aged Witch,Harry,"Not lost are you, my dear?"
Harry,Aged Witch,"I'm fine, thanks. I'm just --"
Hagrid,Harry,"HARRY! What d'yer think yer doin' 
 down 'ere?"
Harry,Hagrid,Hagrid! 
Hagrid,Harry,"Yer a mess! Skulkin' 'round Knockturn Alley. Dodgy place, Harry. Don't want no one ter see yeh down there. People'll be thinkin' yer up ter no good."
Harry,Hagrid,"I was lost, I -- Hang on. What 
 were you doing down there?"
Hagrid,Harry,"I was lookin' fer a Flesh Eatin' 
 Slug Repellent. They're ruinin' 
 the school cabbages."
Hermione,Harry,Harry! 
Hermione,Hagrid,"Hello, Hagrid.  Oh, it's wonderful
 to see you two again."
Hermione,Harry,"Oh, it's wonderful to see you two again."
Hermione,Harry,Oculus Reparo.
Harry,Hermione,I need to remember that one.
Hermione,Harry,C'mon. Everyone's been so worried. 
Mr. Weasley,Mr. Granger,"So you're dentists! Fascinating! 
 I understand other Muggles quite 
 fear you? Why is that?"
Mr. Weasley,Mrs. Granger,"So you're dentists! Fascinating! 
 I understand other Muggles quite 
 fear you? Why is that?"
Mrs. Weasley,Harry,"Oh, Harry. Thank goodness. We 
 hoped you'd only gone one grate 
 too far. Come now. We're off to 
 Flourish and Blotts."
Hermione,Harry,"Isn't it thrilling! Gilderoy 
 Lockhart's going to be there! We 
 can actually meet him! I mean, 
 he's written almost the whole 
 booklist!"
Harry,Hermione,Who?
Mrs. Weasley,Harry,There he is!
Ron,Harry,Mum fancies him.
Short Man,Harry,"Out of the way! This is for The 
 Daily Prophet!"
Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry,It can't be Harry Potter? 
Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry," Nice big smile, Harry. Together, 
 you and I rate the front page. 

 Ladies and gentlemen! What an 
 extraordinary moment this is! 
 When young Harry here stepped into 
 Flourish and Blotts this morning 
 to purchase my autobiography, 
 Magical Me -- which, incidentally 
 is celebrating its twenty-seventh 
 week atop The Daily Prophet's 
 Bestseller List -- he had no idea"
Harry,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Thank you. Slipping free, Harry drifts back into the crowd and, red with embarrassment, drops the books into Ginny's cauldron. HA"
Harry,Ginny,"You have these. I'll buy my 
 own --"
Draco,Harry,"Bet you loved that, didn't you, 
 Potter? Famous Harry Potter. 
 Can't even go into a bookshop 
 without making the front page."
Ginny,Draco,"Leave him alone! He didn't want 
 all that!"
Draco,Harry,"Look, Potter. You've got yourself 
 a girlfriend!"
Lucius Malfoy,Draco,"Silence, Draco! "
Lucius Malfoy,Harry,Ah... Mr. Potter. I don't believe we've met.
Lucius Malfoy,Harry,"Forgive me, Mr. Potter. But your 
 scar is legend. As, of course, is 
 the wizard who gave it to you."
Harry,Lucius Malfoy,He was a murderer.
Lucius Malfoy,Harry,"Yes, a pity about your parents. 
 Curious that you yourself should 
 escape with a mere flesh wound. 
 Curious, too, that you speak of 
 him in the past. Surely, you 
 don't think He-Who-Must-Not-Be- 
 Named is gone forever"
Harry,Lucius Malfoy,"His name is Voldemort. 
 Those within earshot gasp as Harry utters the word."
Lucius Malfoy,Harry,"You must be very brave, Mr. 
 Potter, to dare speak his name. 
 Or foolish."
Hermione,Lucius Malfoy,"Fear of a name only increases fear 
 of the thing itself. "
Lucius Malfoy,Hermione,"You must be Miss Granger. Draco's 
 told me all about you... and your 
 parents. Muggles, aren't you? "
Mr. Weasley,Harry,Ron! Harry! It's mad in here. Let's go outside.
Mr. Weasley,Ron,Ron! Harry! It's mad in here. Let's go outside.
Lucius Malfoy,Mr. Weasley,"Well, well, well -- Arthur 
 Weasley."
Mr. Weasley,Lucius Malfoy,Lucius.
Lucius Malfoy,Mr. Weasley,"Busy time at the Ministry. All 
 those raids. I hope they're 
 paying you overtime. "
Lucius Malfoy,Mr. Weasley,"Obviously not. Dear me. What's 
 the use of being a disgrace to the 
 name of wizard if they don't even 
 pay you well for it."
Mr. Weasley,Lucius Malfoy,"We have a very different idea 
 about what disgraces the name of 
 wizard, Lucius."
Lucius Malfoy,Mr. Weasley," Clearly. The company you keep, 
 Weasley. And I thought your 
 family could sink no lower. "
Hagrid,Mr. Weasley,"Ignore 'im, Arthur. "
Lucius Malfoy,Ginny,"Here, girl. Take your book. It's 
 the best your father can give you."
Hagrid,Harry,"No Malfoy's worth listenin' ter. 
 Rotten ter the core, the whole 
 family..."
Mrs. Weasley,Harry,"Oh dear! The train'll be leaving 
 any moment! All together now! "
Mrs. Weasley,Ron,"Oh dear! The train'll be leaving 
 any moment! All together now! "
Mrs. Weasley,Hermione,"Oh dear! The train'll be leaving 
 any moment! All together now! "
Mrs. Weasley,Ginny,"Oh dear! The train'll be leaving 
 any moment! All together now! "
Mrs. Weasley,Ginny,"Go on, Ginny. You know what to 
 do. "
Mrs. Weasley,Ginny,"Come, Ginny. We'll get you a 
 seat."
Ron,Harry,We better hurry. 
Guard,Harry,"What in blazes d'you two think 
 you're doing?"
Guard,Ron,"What in blazes d'you two think 
 you're doing?"
Harry,Guard,"Sorry. Lost control of the 
 trolley. "
Harry,Ron, Why can't we get through?
Ron,Harry,"I dunno. The gateway's sealed 
 itself for some reason."
Harry,Ron,"The train leaves at exactly eleven 
 o'clock. We've missed it."
Ron,Harry,"Can't hear a thing. 
 Harry. If we can't get through, 
 maybe Mum and Dad can't get back."
Harry,Ron,"Maybe we should go wait by the 
 car."
Ron,Harry,The car!
Harry,Ron,"This is mad. We can't drive to 
 Hogwarts."
Ron,Harry,Who says we're driving?
Harry,Ron,"You don't mean -- Ron, no."
Ron,Harry,"Look, who knows when Mum and Dad 
 will get back. And we've got to 
 get to school, haven't we? And 
 even underage wizards are allowed 
 to use magic if it's an absolute 
 emergency. Least that's what Fred 
 and George always say..."
Harry,Harry,"Something tells me we're going to 
 regret this."
Harry,Ron,"No offense, Ron, but are you sure 
 you know how to fly this."
Ron,Harry,No problem. 
Ron,Harry,"There. See. Now I reckon all we 
 have to do is find the Hogwarts 
 Express and follow it. Simple. "
Harry,Ron,"Uh, Ron. I should tell you. Most 
 Muggles aren't accustomed to 
 seeing a flying car."
Ron,Harry,Right. 
Ron,Harry,"Uh oh. The Invisibility Booster 
 must be faulty. "
Ron,Harry,Any sign of the train?
Harry,Ron,There! Up ahead! Look...
Ron,Harry,Brilliant.
Ron,Harry,"It must be around here 
 someplace."
Harry,Ron,Do you hear that? 
Ron,Harry,Take my hand! 
Ron,Harry,Hold on!
Harry,Ron,I think we found the train.
Ron,Harry,"Welcome home, Harry."
Harry,Ron,"Just out of interest, Ron. Have 
 you ever landed a car before?"
Ron,Harry,"Well... no. but, until a few 
 hours ago, I'd never taken off in 
 one either."
Ron,Harry,Uh oh.
Ron,Harry,IT'S NOT WORKING!
Harry,Ron,UP! UP!
Harry,Ron,MIND THAT TREE!
Harry,Ron,TURN! TURN
Ron,Harry,STOP! STOP! STOP!
Ron,Harry,My wand! Look at my wand !
Harry,Ron,Be thankful it's not your neck.
Ron,Harry,What's happening? 
Ron,Harry,What kind of tree is this?
Harry,Ron,Reverse! Reverse! 
Ron,Harry,Dad's going to kill me.
Harry,Ron,"A house elf shows up in my 
 bedroom, we can't get through the 
 barrier to Platform Nine and Three 
 Quarters, we almost get killed by 
 a tree... clearly someone doesn't 
 want me here this year."
Filch,Harry,"Well, take a good look, lads..."
Filch,Ron,"Well, take a good look, lads..."
Filch,Harry,"This night might well be the last 
 you spend in this castle."
Filch,Ron,"This night might well be the last 
 you spend in this castle."
Snape,Ron,"You were seen! By no less then 
 seven Muggles. Do you have any 
 idea how serious this is? You 
 have risked the exposure of our 
 world. Not to mention the damage 
 you inflicted on a Whomping Willow 
 that has been on these grounds for 
 hundreds of years."
Snape,Harry,"You were seen! By no less then 
 seven Muggles. Do you have any 
 idea how serious this is? You 
 have risked the exposure of our 
 world. Not to mention the damage 
 you inflicted on a Whomping Willow 
 that has been on these grounds for 
 hundreds of years."
Ron,Snape,"Honestly, Professor Snape, I think 
 it did more damage to us."
Snape,Ron,"Silence! I assure you, were you 
 in Slytherin and your fate rested 
 with me, the both of you would be 
 on the train home tonight. As it 
 is --"
Snape,Harry,"Silence! I assure you, were you 
 in Slytherin and your fate rested 
 with me, the both of you would be 
 on the train home tonight. As it 
 is --"
Dumbledore,Snape,They are not.
Harry,Dumbledore,Professor Dumbledore.
Harry,Professor Mcgonagall,"Professor 
 McGonagall..."
Snape,Dumbledore,"Headmaster, these boys have 
 flouted the Decree for the 
 Restriction of Underage Wizardry. 
 As such..."
Dumbledore,Snape,"I'm well aware of our bylaws, 
 Severus, having written more than 
 a few myself. However, as Head of 
 Gryffindor House, it is for 
 Professor McGonagall to determine 
 the appropriate action."
Ron,Dumbledore,We'll go and get our stuff.
Professor Mcgonagall,Ron," What are you talking about, Mr. 
 Weasley?"
Ron,Professor Mcgonagall,"Well, you're going to expel us,
 aren't you?"
Professor Mcgonagall,Ron,"Not today, Mr. Weasley. But I 
 must impress upon both of you the 
 seriousness of what you have done. 
 I will be sending owls to both of 
 your families tonight. And you 
 will each get a detention."
Professor Mcgonagall,Harry,But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be sending owls to both of your families tonight. And you will each get a detention.
Dumbledore,Professor Mcgonagall,"Splendid. Now, I suggest we 
 return to the feast. There's a 
 delicious-looking custard tart I 
 want to sample."
Dumbledore,Snape,"Splendid. Now, I suggest we 
 return to the feast. There's a 
 delicious-looking custard tart I 
 want to sample."
Dumbledore,Harry,"Splendid. Now, I suggest we 
 return to the feast. There's a 
 delicious-looking custard tart I 
 want to sample."
Dumbledore,Ron,"Splendid. Now, I suggest we 
 return to the feast. There's a 
 delicious-looking custard tart I 
 want to sample."
Harry,Filch,Mr. Filch. You dropped this...
Neville,Harry,Detention. On the first day?
Neville,Ron,Detention. On the first day?
Seamus,Neville,That must be some kind of record.
Hermione,Ron,I should think you'd count yourself lucky that's all you got.
Ron,Hermione,"I should think you'd mind your own 
 business."
Professor Sprout,Hermione,"Welcome to Greenhouse Three, 
 Second Years. Today, we will be 
 re-potting Mandrakes. Now, who 
 here can tell me the properties of 
 the Mandrake? Yes, Miss Granger."
Hermione,Professor Sprout,"Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used 
 to return those who have been 
 transfigured to their original 
 state. It's also quite dangerous. 
 The Mandrake's cry is fatal to 
 anyone who hears it."
Professor Sprout,Hermione,"Excellent. Ten points to 
 Gryffindor. As our Mandrakes are 
 only seedlings, their cries won't 
 kill yet. However, they will 
 knock you out for several hours. 
 That is why I have provided each 
 of you with a pair of earmuffs"
Professor Sprout,Neville,"Hm. Looks as though Mr. 
 Longbottom neglected his muffs."
Seamus,Professor Sprout,"No, ma'am. He's just fainted."
Professor Sprout,Seamus,"Very well. We'll just leave him 
 then. Come now. Four to a tray, 
 plenty of pots to go round..."
Penelope Clearwater,Percy,There's Nearly Headless Nick.
Percy,Nearly Headless Nick,"Hello, Sir Nicolas."
Nearly Headless Nick,Percy,"Hello, Percy. Miss Clearwater."
Nearly Headless Nick,Penelope Clearwater,Miss Clearwater.
Ron,Harry,Say it. I'm doomed
Harry,Ron,You're doomed. 
Colin,Harry,"Hiya, Harry. I'm Colin Creevey. 
 I'm in Gryffindor too."
Harry,Colin,"Hello, Colin. Nice to meet --"
Colin,Harry,"They're for my dad -- the 
 pictures. He's a milkman, you 
 know, a Muggle, like all our 
 family's been until me. No one 
 knew all the odd stuff I could do 
 was magic till we got my letter 
 from Hogwarts. Everyone just 
 thought I was mental."
Ron,Colin,Imagine that.
Colin,Harry,"Say, Harry. D'you think your 
 friend could take a photo of me 
 and you standing together? Ya' 
 know, to prove I've met you?"
Dean,Ron,Post is here! 
Ron,Seamus,"Bloody bird's a menace -- Oh... 
 no"
Seamus,Ron,"Heads up, everyone. Weasley's 
 gotten himself a Howler."
Neville,Ron,"Go on, Ron. I ignored one from
my Gran once... and it was
horrible."
Mrs. Weasley,Ron,"RONALD WEASLEY! HOW DARE YOU
STEAL THAT CAR! I AM
ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED! YOUR
FATHER'S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY
AT WORK AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR
FAULT! IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT
OF LINE WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT
HOME! "
Mrs. Weasley,Ginny,"Oh, and Ginny dear. Congratulations on making Gryffindor. Your father and I are so proud."
Harry,Ron,"Look at it this way. How much
worse can things get?"
Gilderoy Lockhart,Students,"Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts
Teacher. Me. Gilderoy Lockhart,
Order of Merlin, Third Class,
Honorary Member of the Dark Force
Defense League and five times
winner of Witch Weekly's Most-
Charming-Smile Award -- But I
don't talk about that. I didn't
get rid of the Bandon Banshee by
smiling at her!"
Gilderoy Lockhart,Students,"I see you've all bought a complete
set of my books. Well done. I
thought we'd start today with a
little quiz. Nothing to worry
about. Just to check how well
you've read them, how much you've
taken in..."
Ron,Harry,"Look at these questions. They're
all about him."
Harry,Ron,"What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
favorite color?'"
Ron,Harry,"What is Gilderoy Lockhart's
greatest achievement to date?'"
Harry,Ron,"When is Gilderoy Lockhart's
birthday and what would his ideal
gift be?'"
Gilderoy Lockhart,Students,"You have thirty minutes. Start --
now!"
Gilderoy Lockhart,Students,"Tut, tut. Hardly any of you
remembered my favorite color is
lilac. But Miss Hermione Granger
knew that my secret ambition is to
rid the world of evil and market
my own range of hair care potions.
Good girl."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Students,"Now... be warned! It is my job to
arm you against the foulest
creatures known to wizardkind!
You may find yourself facing your
own worst fears in this room.
Know only that no harm can befall
you whilst I am here..."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Students,"I must ask you not to scream. It
might provoke them."
Seamus,Gilderoy Lockhart,Cornish pixies?
Gilderoy Lockhart,Seamus,Freshly caught Cornish pixies.
Gilderoy Lockhart,Students,"Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnegan,
but pixies can be devilishly
tricky little blighters. Let's
see what you make of them now!"
Gilderoy Lockhart,Students,"Come on now, round them up, round
them up. They're only pixies. Peskipiski Pesternomi!"
Gilderoy Lockhart,Students,"I'll ask you three to just nip the
rest of them back into their cage."
Ron,Gilderoy Lockhart,What do we do now?
Hermione,Ron,Immobilus!
Neville,Hermione,Why is it always me?
Ron,Hermione,Can you believe him?
Hermione,Ron,"I'm sure Professor Lockhart just
wanted to give us some hands-on
experience."
Harry,Hermione,"Hands on? Hermione, he didn't
have a clue what he was doing."
Hermione,Harry,"Rubbish. Read his books. You'll
see all the amazing things he's
done."
Ron,Hermione,He says he's done.
Wood,Ron,"I spent the summer devising a
whole new Quidditch program.
We're going to train earlier,
harder, and longer!

What the... I don't believe it!"
Ron,Wood,Uh-oh. I smell trouble.
Wood,Flint,"Clear out, Flint! I booked the
pitch for Gryffindor today."
Flint,Wood,"Easy, Wood. I've got a note."
Wood,Flint,"I, Professor Severus Snape, do
hereby give the Slytherin team
permission to practice today,
owing to the need to train their
new Seeker.'

You've got a new Seeker? Who?"
Harry,Wood,Draco?
Draco,Harry,"That's right. And that's not all
that's new this year..."
Ron,Draco,"Those are Nimbus Two Thousand
Ones."
Flint,Ron,"A generous gift from Draco's
father."
Draco,Ron,"That's right, Weasley. You see,
unlike some, my father can afford
to buy the best."
Hermione,Draco,"At least no one on the Gryffindor
team had to buy their way in.
They got in on pure talent."
Draco,Hermione,"No one asked your opinion, you
filthy little Mudblood."
Wood,Draco,Save it for the match.
Ron,Draco,"You'll pay for that one, Malfoy!

Eat slugs!"
Hermione,Ron,Ron! Say something!
Colin,Harry,"Wow! Can you hold him still,
Harry?!"
Harry,Colin,"Get out of the way, Colin!"
Harry,Hermione,Let's take him to Hagrid. He'll know what to do.
Hagrid,Harry,"Got jus' the thing. Set 'im down
on that chair o'er there."
Hagrid,Harry,"Better out than in. Who was he
tryin' ter curse anyway?"
Harry,Hagrid,"Malfoy. He called Hermione, well,
I don't know exactly what it
means..."
Hermione,Hagrid,He called me a Mudblood.
Hagrid,Hermione,He didn'!
Hermione,Harry,"It means dirty blood. Mudblood's
a really foul name for someone who
was Muggle-born. Someone with
non-magic parents. Someone...
like me. It's not a term one
usually hears in civilized
conversation."
Hagrid,Harry,"Yeh see, Harry. There are some
wizards -- like Malfoy's family --
who think they're better than
everyone else 'cause they're what
people call pureblood."
Harry,Hagrid,That's horrible.
Ron,Harry,It's disgusting!
Hagrid,Ron,"An' it's codswallop ter boot.
Dirty blood. There's 'ardly a
wizard today that's not half-blood
or less. If we 'adn't married
Muggles we'd've died out long ago."
Hagrid,Hermione,"Besides, they haven't invented a spell our Hermione can't do... Don' you think on it, Hermione. Don' you think on it fer a minute."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry,"Harry, Harry, Harry... Can you
possibly imagine a better way to
serve detention than by helping me
answer my fan mail?"
Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry,"Fame's a fickle friend, Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.
Remember that."
Voice,Harry,Come... come to me...
Harry,Voice,What?
Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry,"I was saying, six solid months at
the top of the bestseller list!
Broke all records!"
Harry,Gilderoy Lockhart,"No... not you, that... voice."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry,Voice?
Harry,Gilderoy Lockhart,"That... voice. Didn't you hear
it?"
Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry,"What are you talking about, Harry?
I think we're getting a bit
drowsy. Great Scott -- and no
wonder -- look at the time! We've
been here nearly four hours!
Dinner's nearly done! If you
hurry you might make pudding.
Spooky how the time flies when
one's having fun!"
Harry,Gilderoy Lockhart,Spooky.
Voice,Harry,Blood... I smell blood...
Voice,Harry,"Let me rip you... let me kill
you..."
Hermione,Harry,Harry!
Harry,Hermione,Did you hear it?
Ron,Harry,Hear what?
Harry,Ron,That... voice.
Hermione,Harry,Voice? What voice?
Harry,Hermione,"I heard it first in Lockhart's
office and then again, just --"
Voice,Harry,Kill... Time to kill...
Harry,Hermione,"It's moving. I think it's going
to... kill."
Ron,Harry,"Harry, what are you doing?"
Harry,Harry,"The Chamber of Secrets has been
opened...?'"
Ron,Harry,What's that? Hanging underneath?
Harry,Ron,That's Filch's cat. Mrs. Norris.
Hermione,Ron,"Look at that. Have you ever seen
spiders act like that? Ron...?"
Ron,Hermione,I... don't... like... spiders.
Draco,Ron,"Enemies of the heir, beware!
You'll be next, Mudbloods!"
Filch,Students,"What's going on here? Go on now!
Make way...

Mrs. Norris!

You! You've murdered my cat!
I'll kill you! I'll --"
Dumbledore,Filch,Argus!
Dumbledore,Students,"Everyone will proceed to their
dormitories immediately."
Dumbledore,Harry,Everyone except you three.
Dumbledore,Ron,Everyone except you three.
Dumbledore,Hermione,Everyone except you three.
Gilderoy Lockhart,Dumbledore,"It was definitely a curse that
killed her -- probably the
Transmogrifian Torture.
Encountered it myself once, in
Ouagadougou. The full story's in
my autobiography..."
Dumbledore,Filch,"She's not dead, Argus. She's been
Petrified."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Dumbledore,"Precisely! So unlucky I wasn't
there. I know the very
countercurse that could have
spared her..."
Dumbledore,Filch,"But how she's been Petrified... I
cannot say."
Filch,Dumbledore,"Ask him! It's him that's done it.
You saw what he wrote on the wall!
Besides, he knows I'm -- I'm a
Squib."
Harry,Filch,"It's not true, sir! I swear! I
never touched Mrs. Norris -- And I
don't even know what a Squib is."
Filch,Dumbledore,"Rubbish! He saw my Kwikspell
letter!"
Snape,Dumbledore,"If I might, Headmaster..."
Snape,Dumbledore,"Perhaps Potter and his friends
were simply in the wrong place at
the wrong time..."
Snape,Dumbledore,"However, the circumstances are
suspicious. I, for one, don't
recall seeing Potter at dinner."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Snape,"I'm afraid that's my doing,
Severus. You see, Harry was
helping me answer my fan mail..."
Hermione,Gilderoy Lockhart,"That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We'd just
found him when Harry said..."
Snape,Hermione,"Yes, Miss Granger?"
Harry,Snape,"When I said I wasn't hungry. We
were heading back to the Common
Room and... found Mrs. Norris."
Dumbledore,Harry,Innocent until proven guilty.
Filch,Dumbledore,"My cat has been Petrified! I want
to see some punishment!"
Dumbledore,Filch,"We will be able to cure her,
Argus. As I understand it, Madam
Sprout has a very healthy growth
of Mandrakes. When they have
matured, a potion will be made
which will revive Mrs. Norris. In
the meantime, I advise caution.
To all."
Ron,Hermione,"A Squib's someone who's born into
a wizarding family but hasn't got
any powers of their own. It's why
Filch is trying to learn magic
from a Kwikspell course. It's
also why he hates students so
much. He's bitter."
Hermione,Harry,"Harry. This voice. You said you
heard it first in Lockhart's
office?"
Harry,Hermione,Yes.
Hermione,Harry,And did he hear it?
Harry,Hermione,He said he didn't.
Ron,Harry,Maybe he was lying.
Hermione,Ron,"I hardly think someone with
Gilderoy Lockhart's credentials
would lie to one of his students,
Ronald. Besides, if you recall,
we didn't hear anything either."
Harry,Hermione,"You do believe me, don't you?"
Hermione,Harry,"Course we do. It's just... it's
a bit weird, isn't it? You hear
this voice and then... Mrs. Norris
turns up Petrified."
Harry,Hermione,"I can't explain it -- it was...
scary.

D'you think I should've told them
-- Dumbledore and the others, I mean."
Ron,Harry,Are you mad!
Hermione,Harry,"No, Harry. Even in the wizarding
world, hearing voices isn't a good
sign."
Professor Mcgonagall,Students,"Today, we will be turning animals
into water goblets."
Professor Mcgonagall,Ron,"Now, who would like to go first...
Mr. Weasley?"
Professor Mcgonagall,Ron,"You must replace that wand, Mr.
Weasley."
Professor Mcgonagall,Hermione,"Yes, Miss Granger?"
Hermione,Professor Mcgonagall,"Professor, I was wondering if you
could tell us about the Chamber of
Secrets?"
Professor Mcgonagall,Hermione,"My subject is Transfiguration,
Miss Granger."
Hermione,Professor Mcgonagall,"Yes, Professor. But there seems
to be very little written about
the Chamber of Secrets. For those
of us with a personal interest in
the subject, that is...
disturbing."
Professor Mcgonagall,Hermione,"Very well. You all know, of
course, that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago by the
four greatest witches and wizards
of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga
Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and
Salazar Slytherin. Three of the
founders co-existed quite
harmoniously. One did not."
Ron,Professor Mcgonagall,Three glasses who?
Professor Mcgonagall,Ron,"Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective about the students
admitted to Hogwarts. He believed
that magical learning should be
kept within all-magic families.
In other words, purebloods.
Unable to sway the others, he
decided to leave the school.

According to legend, Slytherin had
built a hidden chamber in this
castle, known as the Chamber of
Secrets. Shortly before
departing, he sealed it until that
time when his own true heir
returned to the school. The heir
alone would be able to open the
Chamber of Secrets and unleash the
horror within, and by so doing,
purge the school of all those who,
in Slytherin's view, were unworthy
to study magic."
Hermione,Professor Mcgonagall,Muggle-borns.
Professor Mcgonagall,Hermione,"Yes. Naturally, the school has been
searched many times for such a
chamber. It has never been found."
Hermione,Professor Mcgonagall,"Professor, what exactly does
legend tell us lies within the
Chamber?"
Professor Mcgonagall,Hermione,"The Chamber is said to be home to
something which the heir of Slytherin
alone can control. It is said to be
home... to a monster."
Ron,Hermione,"D'you think it's true? D'you
think there really is a Chamber of
Secrets?"
Hermione,Ron,"Yes. Couldn't you tell:
McGonagall's worried. All the
teachers are."
Harry,Hermione,"But if there really is a Chamber
of Secrets, and it's really been
opened, that means..."
Hermione,Harry,"The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is, who
is it?"
Ron,Hermione,"Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks Muggle-borns are scum."
Hermione,Ron,If you're talking about him --
Ron,Hermione,"Of course! You heard him:
'You'll be next, Mudbloods'!"
Hermione,Ron,"I heard him. But Malfoy? The
Heir of Slytherin?"
Harry,Hermione,"Maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I
mean, look at his family. The
whole lot of them have been in
Slytherin for centuries."
Ron,Harry,"Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe
we could trick them into
telling..."
Hermione,Ron,"No. Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.
Mind you, it would be difficult.
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about fifty school rules. And it
would be dangerous. Very
dangerous."
Ron,Hermione,When do we start?
Hermione,Ron,"Here it is: 'The Polyjuice
Potion. Properly brewed, the
Polyjuice Potion allows the
drinker to transform himself
temporarily into the physical form
of another...'"
Ron,Hermione,"You mean, Harry and I drink some
of this stuff and we turn into
Crabbe and Goyle?"
Hermione,Ron,Yes.
Ron,Hermione,Wicked! Malfoy'll tell us anything!
Hermione,Ron,"Exactly. But it's tricky. I've
never seen a more complicated
potion. Lacewing flies, leeches,
fluxweed. And, of course, we'll
need a bit of whoever we want to
change into too."
Ron,Hermione,"Hang on now. I'm drinking nothing
with Crabbe's toenails in it."
Harry,Ron,How long will it take to make?
Hermione,Harry,A month.
Harry,Hermione,"A month? But if Malfoy is the
heir of Slytherin... he could
attack half the Muggle-borns in
the school by then."
Hermione,Harry,You didn't have to tell me that.
Hagrid,Ron,"Gallopin' Gorgons! Slytherin's
flyin' like they got dragon fire
in their brooms..."
Draco,Harry,"All right there, Scarhead?"
George,Harry,HARRY! WATCH OUT!
Hagrid,Ron,"Blimey, Harry's got 'imself a
Rogue Bludger!"
Ron,Hagrid,Rogue Bludger?
Hagrid,Ron,"Look fer yerself! It's bin'
tampered with!"
Hermione,Hagrid,"You're joking, right? Besides,
even with a proper wand, it's too
risky. You could hit Harry."
Draco,Harry,"Training for the ballet, Potter?"
Hermione,Draco,Finite Incantatem!
Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry,"Not to worry, Harry. I'll fix
that arm of yours straight away."
Harry,Gilderoy Lockhart,No... no... not you.
Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry,"Poor boy doesn't know what he's
saying. This won't hurt a bit..."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry,"Ah. Yes. Well, that can
sometimes happen. The point is,
the bones are no longer broken."
Hagrid,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Brok'n? He doesn't 'ave any bones
at all!"
Madam Pomfrey,Hagrid,"He should have been brought
straight to me! I can mend bones
in a heartbeat -- but growing them
back --"
Hermione,Madam Pomfrey,"You will be able to, won't you?"
Madam Pomfrey,Hermione,"I'll be able to, certainly, but it
will be painful. You're in for a
rough night, Potter. Regrowing
bones is nasty business."
Madam Pomfrey,Hermione,"Well, what did you expect --
pumpkin juice?"
Colin,Harry,"That was brilliant today, Harry!
Brilliant!"
Madam Pomfrey,Students,"Out! All of you! This boy's got
thirty-three bones to regrow!"
Harry,Dobby,Dobby!
Dobby,Harry,"Harry Potter came back to school.
Dobby warned him. Harry Potter
should have listened to Dobby.
Harry Potter should have gone back
home when he missed the train."
Harry,Dobby,"It was you! You stopped the
barrier from letting Ron and me
through!"
Dobby,Harry,"Indeed yes, sir. Dobby hid and
watched for Harry Potter and
sealed the gateway."
Harry,Dobby,"You nearly got Ron and me
expelled!"
Dobby,Harry,"At least you would be away from
here. Harry Potter must go home!
Dobby thought his Bludger would be
enough to make Harry Potter see --"
Harry,Dobby,"Your Bludger? You made that
Bludger chase after me?"
Dobby,Harry,"Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir.

Dobby had to iron his hands..."
Harry,Dobby,"You'd better clear off before my
bones come back, Dobby, or I might
strangle you!"
Dobby,Harry,"Dobby is used to death threats,
sir. Dobby gets them five times a
day at home."
Harry,Dobby,"I don't suppose you could tell me
why you're trying to kill me?"
Dobby,Harry,"Not kill you, sir, never kill you!
Dobby remembers how it was before
Harry Potter triumphed over He Who
Must Not Be Named. We house elves
were treated like vermin, sir. Of
course, Dobby is still treated
like vermin..."
Harry,Dobby,"Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?"
Dobby,Harry,"This, sir? 'Tis a mark of the
house elf's enslavement. Dobby
can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes. The
family is careful not to pass
Dobby so much as a sock, sir, for
then he would be free to leave
their house forever."
Dobby,Harry,"Terrible things are about to
happen at Hogwarts! Harry Potter
must not stay here now that
history is to repeat itself!"
Harry,Dobby,"Repeat itself? You mean, this has
happened before?"
Harry,Dobby,"Tell me, Dobby? When did this
happen before? Who's doing it
now?"
Dobby,Harry,"Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only
wants Harry Potter to be safe."
Harry,Dobby,"Who is it?
No, Dobby! Tell me!"
Madam Pomfrey,Dumbledore,What's happened?
Dumbledore,Madam Pomfrey,There's been another attack.
Professor Mcgonagall,Dumbledore,"Perhaps he managed to get a
picture of his attacker..."
Professor Mcgonagall,Dumbledore,"What does this mean, Albus?"
Dumbledore,Professor Mcgonagall,"It means our students are in great
danger, Minerva. Mr. Creevey was
fortunate. If not for this...
(holding up the camera)
He would surely be dead."
Professor Mcgonagall,Dumbledore,"What sould I tell the staff,
Albus?"
Dumbledore,Professor Mcgonagall,"Tell them the truth. Tell them
Hogwarts is no longer safe. Tell
them it's as we feared. The
Chamber of Secrets is indeed open
again."
Hermione,Professor Mcgonagall,"Again? You mean, the Chamber of
Secrets has been opened before?"
Ron,Hermione,"Of course! Don't you see? Lucius
Malfoy must've opened it when he
was at school here, and now he's
told Draco how to do it."
Hermione,Ron,"Maybe. We'll have to wait for the
Polyjuice Potion to know for sure."
Ron,Hermione,"Enlighten me. Why are we
brewing this potion in broad
daylight, in the middle of a
girls' lavatory? Don't you think
we'll get caught?"
Hermione,Ron,Never. No one over comes in here.
Ron,Hermione,Why?
Hermione,Ron,Moaning Myrtle.
Ron,Hermione,Who's Moaning Myrtle?
Moaning Myrtle,Ron,"I'm Moaning Myrtle. I wouldn't
expect you to know me. Who
would ever talk about fat, ugly,
miserable, moping, moaning
Myrtle?"
Hermione,Ron,She's a little sensitive.
Gilderoy Lockhart,Students,"Gather round! Gather round! Can
everyone see me? Can you all hear
me? Excellent. In light of the
dark events of recent weeks,
Professor Dumbledore has granted
me permission to start this little
Dueling Club, to train you all up
in case you ever need to defend
yourselves as I myself have done
on countless occasions -- for full
details, see my published works."
Justin Finch-Fletchley,Harry,"That Lockhart's something, isn't
he? Awfully brave chap.

Justin Finch-Fletchley.
Hufflepuff."
Harry,Justin Finch-Fletchley,Nice to meet you. I'm --
Justin Finch-Fletchley,Harry,"I know who you are. We all do.
Even us Muggle-borns."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Students,"Let me introduce my assistant
Professor Snape. He has
sportingly agreed to help me with
a short demonstration. Now I
don't want any of you youngsters
to worry. You'll still have your
Potions Master when I'm through
with him, never fear!"
Ron,Gilderoy Lockhart,What's the fun in that?
Gilderoy Lockhart,Ron,"As you can see, we are holding our
wands in the accepted combative
position. On the count of three,
we will cast our first spells.
Neither of us will be aiming to
kill, of course."
Harry,Gilderoy Lockhart,I wouldn't bet on that.
Gilderoy Lockhart,Students,One-two-three --
Snape,Gilderoy Lockhart,Expelliarmus!
Hermione,Harry,Do you think he's all right?
Hermione,Ron,Do you think he's all right?
Harry,Hermione,Who cares?
Ron,Hermione,Who cares?
Gilderoy Lockhart,Students,"Well, there you have it. That was
a Disarming Charm. As you see,
I've lost my wand."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Hermione,"Ah, thank you, Miss Granger. Yes,
an excellent idea to show them
that, Professor Snape, but if you
don't mind my saying so, it was
very obvious what you were about
to do. If I had wanted to stop
you it would have been only too
easy..."
Snape,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Perhaps it would be prudent to
first teach the students to block
unfriendly spells, Professor."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Snape,"An excellent suggestion, Professor
Snape. Let's have a volunteer
pair. Potter, Weasley, how about
you?"
Snape,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Weasley's wand causes devastation
with the simplest spells. We'll
be sending Potter to the hospital
wing in a matchbox. Might I
suggest someone from my own house.
Malfoy, perhaps."
Draco,Harry,"Scared, Potter?"
Harry,Draco,You wish.
Gilderoy Lockhart,Students,"Wands at the ready! When I count
to three, cast your charms to
disarm your opponent -- only to
disarm. We don't want any
accidents. One, two --"
Harry,Draco,Rictusempra!
Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry,I said disarm only!
Draco,Harry,Serpensortia!
Snape,Harry,"Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid
of it for you."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Snape,Allow me!
Harry,Gilderoy Lockhart,Leave him!
Harry,Gilderoy Lockhart,LEAVE HIM!
Justin Finch-Fletchley,Ron,What are you playing at?
Ron,Justin Finch-Fletchley,Come on. Move. Now.
Ron,Harry,"You're a Parselmouth! Why didn't
you tell us?"
Harry,Ron,I'm a what?
Hermione,Harry,You can talk to snakes.
Harry,Hermione,"I know. I mean, I accidentally
set a python on my cousin Dudley
at the zoo once. But so what? I
bet loads of people here can do
it."
Hermione,Harry,"No. They can't. It's not a very
common gift, Harry. This is bad."
Harry,Hermione,"What's bad? If I hadn't told that
snake not to attack Justin --"
Ron,Harry,"Oh, that's what you said to it."
Harry,Ron,You were there! You heard me!
Ron,Harry,"I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language."
Harry,Ron,"I spoke a different language? But
I didn't realize -- how can I
speak a language without knowing I
can?"
Hermione,Harry,"I don't know, Harry. But it
sounded like you were egging the
snake on or something. It was...
creepy."
Hermione,Harry,"Harry, listen out me. There's a
reason the symbol of Slytherin
house is a serpent. Salazar
Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He
could talk to snakes too."
Ron,Harry,"Exactly. And now the whole
school's going to think you're his
great-great-great grandson or
something."
Harry,Ron,But I'm not. I... can't be.
Hermione,Harry,"He lived a thousand years ago.
For all we know... you could be."
Harry,Hermione,"Who am I, Hedwig? What am I?"
Ernie,Hannah,"So, anyway, I told Justin to hide
up in our dormitory. I mean to
say, if Potter's marked him down
as his next victim, it's best he
keep a low profile for a while."
Hannah,Ernie,"But why would he want to attack
Justin?"
Ernie,Hannah,"Justin let it slip to Potter that
he was Muggle-born."
Hannah,Ernie,"And you definitely think Potter's
the Heir of Slytherin?"
Ernie,Hannah,"Hannah, he's a Parselmouth. Everyone knows that's the mark of a dark wizard. Have you ever heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes? They called Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue.  Remember what was written on the wall: Enemies of the Heir Beware. Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing we know, Filch's cat's attacked. That first-year Creevey's been annoying Potter. Then Creevey's attacked."
Hannah,Ernie,"He always seems so nice, though. And, after all, he is the one who made You Know Who disappear."
Ernie,Hannah,That's probably why You Know Who wanted to kill him in the first place. Didn't want another Dark Lord competing with him.
Hagrid,Harry,"All righ', Harry?"
Harry,Hagrid,Hagrid... what're you doing here?
Hagrid,Harry,"Second one killed this term. 
Reckon it's either foxes or a 
Blood-Suckin' Bugbear. Need 
Dumbledore's permission ter put a 
charm round the hen-coop. Yeh 
sure yeh're all righ', Harry? Yeh 
look all hot an' bothered."
Harry,Hagrid,"It's nothing. I'd better get 
going. I've got a lot of 
studying..."
Harry,Professor Mcgonagall,"Professor, I swear I didn't"
Professor Mcgonagall,Filch,"This is out of my hands, Potter. 
Mr. Filch, will you take care of
this, please?"
Filch,Harry,"Caught in the act. I'll have you 
out this time, Potter. Mark my 
words… Dark magic. That's what you've 
got, Potter. Even the air you 
breathe comes out poison. You're 
evil. Evil as they come…"
Professor Mcgonagall,Harry,Sherbet lemon. Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you.
Sorting Hat,Harry,"Bee in your bonnet, Potter?"
Harry,Sorting Hat,"Well, you see, I was wondering..."
Sorting Hat,Harry,"If I put you in the right house? 
Yes... you were particularly 
difficult to place. But I stand 
by what I said last year... You 
would have done well in Slytherin."
Harry,Sorting Hat,"You're wrong!
"
Harry,Dumbledore,"Professor, your bird... I couldn't 
do anything... He just caught 
fire."
Dumbledore,Harry,"About time too. He's been looking 
dreadful for days. Pity you had 
to see him on a Burning Day. He's 
really very handsome most of the 
time. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. 
Phoenixes burst into flame when it 
is time for them to die and are 
reborn from the ashes.Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. 
They can carry immensely heavy 
loads, their tears have healing 
powers, and they make highly 
faithful pets."
Hagrid,Dumbledore,"It wasn't Harry, Professor 
Dumbledore!"
Dumbledore,Hagrid,Hagrid --
Hagrid,Dumbledore,"I was talkin' ter 'im jus' before 
that kid was found. It can't've 
bin 'im!"
Dumbledore,Hagrid,Hagrid --
Hagrid,Dumbledore,"I'll swear ter it in front o' the 
Ministry o' Magic --"
Dumbledore,Hagrid,"HAGRID! I do not think that Harry
has attacked anyone."
Hagrid,Dumbledore,"Oh. Right. I'll wait outside 
then."
Harry,Dumbledore,"You don't think it was me, 
Professor?"
Dumbledore,Harry,"No, Harry. But I must ask you… 
is there anything you'd like to 
tell me. Anything at all?"
Harry,Dumbledore,"No, Professor. Nothing."
Fred,Harry,"Make way for the Heir of 
Slytherin! Seriously evil wizard 
coming through!"
Ron,Harry,"Oh, c'mon, Harry. Fred's just 
having a laugh."
Harry,Ron,He's the only one.
Ron,Harry,"Okay, so half the school thinks 
you're nipping off to the Chamber 
of Secrets every night. Who 
cares?"
Harry,Ron,Maybe they're right.
Hermione,Harry,Harry!
Harry,Hermione,"I didn't know I could speak 
Parseltongue. What else don't I 
know about myself? Maybe you can 
do something... even something 
horrible... and not know you did 
it."
Hermione,Harry,"You don't believe that, Harry, I 
know you don't. And if it makes 
you feel better, I just heard 
Malfoy's staying over for holiday, 
too."
Ron,Hermione,"Why would that make anyone feel 
better?"
Hermione,Ron,"Because, in a few days, the 
Polyjuice Potion's will be ready. 
In a few days... we may truly know 
who is the Heir of Slytherin.Everything's set. We just need a 
bit of who you're changing into."
Harry,Hermione,Crabbe and Goyle.
Hermione,Harry,"And we also need to make sure that 
the real Crabbe and Goyle can't 
burst in on us while we're 
interrogating Malfoy."
Ron,Hermione,How?
Hermione,Ron,"I've got it all worked out. I've 
filled these with a simple 
Sleeping Draught. Simple, but 
powerful. You know how greedy Crabbe and 
Goyle are. They won't leave the 
Christmas Feast until every last 
drop of trifle is gone. Now, once they're asleep, hide 
them in a broom cupboard and pull 
out a few of their hairs."
Ron,Hermione,And whose hair are you ripping out?
Hermione,Ron,"I've already got mine. Millicent Bulstrode. She's in 
Slytherin. I got this off her 
robes.All right then... I'm going to 
check on the Polyjuice Potion. Remember. Just make sure Crabbe 
and Goyle find these "
Ron,Hermione,"Have you ever heard of a plan 
where so many things could go 
wrong?"
Hermione,Ron,"Did you get it? I sneaked those out of the 
laundry. I'm sure I've done everything 
right. It looks like the book 
said it should. Once we've drunk 
it, we'll have exactly one hour 
before we change back into 
ourselves."
Ron,Hermione,Now what?
Hermione,Ron,"We separate it into three glasses 
and add the hairs."
Ron,Harry,Ugh. Essence of Crabbe…Think I'm gonna be sick…Harry?
Harry,Ron,Ron?
Ron,Harry,Bloody hell.
Harry,Ron,"We still sound like ourselves. 
You need to sound more like 
Crabbe."
Ron,Harry,Bloody hell.
Harry,Ron,Lower.
Ron,Harry,Bloody hell.
Harry,Ron,Less intelligent
Ron,Harry,Bloody hell.
Harry,Ron,Excellent.
Ron,Harry,Hey... Where's Hermione?
Hermione,Harry,"I -- I don't think I'm going. You 
go on without me."
Harry,Hermione,"Hermione, are you okay?"
Hermione,Harry,Just go! You're wasting time!
Ron,Harry,"Don't swing your arms like that. 
Crabbe holds them sort of stiff. Yeah. That's better. What are you doing here? What are you doing here?"
Percy,Ron,"I happen to be a prefect. You, on 
the other hand, have no business 
wandering the corridors at night. 
It's not safe these days. What're your names again?"
Draco,Ron,"Crabbe. Goyle. Where have you 
been? Pigging out in the Great 
Hall all this time?"
Draco,Percy,"And what are you doing down here, 
Weasley?"
Percy,Draco,"Mind your attitude, Malfoy. You 
want to show a little bit more 
respect to a school Prefect!"
Draco,Ron,"Come on, boys. Weasley thinks 
he's going to catch Slytherin's 
hair single-handed. Listen to this…"
Draco,Harry,"Arthur Weasley, Head of the 
Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, 
was today fined fifty Galleons for 
bewitching a Muggle car. ""Weasley 
has brought the Ministry into 
disrepute,"" said Lucius Malfoy, a 
governor of Hogwarts. ""He is 
clearly unfit to draw up our laws 
and his ridiculous Muggle 
Protection Act should be scrapped 
immediately. ""'Arthur Weasley loves Muggle so 
much he should snap his wand in 
half and go join them. You'd 
never know the Weasleys were 
purebloods, the way they behave. 
Embarrassment to the wizarding 
world. All of them. What's up with you, Crabbe?"
Ron,Draco,Stomachache.
Draco,Ron,"Well, go to the hospital wing 
and give all those Mudbloods a kick 
in the arse for me! You know, I'm 
surprised The Daily Prophet hasn't 
reported all these attacks yet. I 
suppose Dumbledore's trying to hush 
it all up. He'll be sacked if it 
doesn't stop soon. Father always 
said Dumbledore's the worst thing 
that's ever happened to this place."
Harry,Draco,You're wrong!
Draco,Harry,"What? Did you say that I was 
wrong? You think there's someone 
here who's worse than Dumbledore?"
Harry,Draco,Harry Potter.
Draco,Harry,"Good one, Goyle. You're 
absolutely right. Saint Potter. 
He's another one with no proper 
wizard feeling, or he wouldn't go 
around with that Mudblood Granger. 
And people actually think he's the 
Heir of Slytherin."
Harry,Draco,Then you must have some idea who's behind it all?
Draco,Harry,"You know I haven't, Goyle. How 
many times do I have to tell you? 
But my father did say this much: 
It's been fifty years since the 
Chamber was opened. He wouldn't 
tell me who opened it -- only that 
they were expelled -- but I know 
this: the last time the Chamber 
of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood 
died. So it's only a matter of time 
before one of them's killed this 
time. As for me... I hope it's 
Granger. What's the matter with you two? 
You're acting very... odd."
Ron,Harry,Ho!
Draco,Ron,Hey! Where are you going?
Ron,Harry,That was close!
Harry,Hermione,"Hermione, come out. We've got 
loads to tell you!"
Hermione,Harry,Go away!
Moaning Myrtle,Harry,"Ooh, wait till you see. It's 
awful!"
Hermione,Harry,"Do you remember me telling you the 
Polyjuice Potion was only for 
human transformations...? It was cat hair I plucked off 
Millicent Bulstrode's robes! Look 
at my face!It was cat hair I plucked off 
Millicent Bulstrode's robes! Look 
at my face!"
Ron,Hermione,Look at your tail.
Hermione,Ron,"Oh, good. Put those anywhere."
Ron,Hermione,"Madam Pince asked that we relay a 
message to you, Hermione:  She'd 
appreciate it if you'd leave a few 
books for the rest of the school."
Hermione,Ron,"I've got to keep up, haven't I?"
Ron,Hermione,Is that thing ever going away?
Hermione,Ron,"Any day now, according to Madam 
Pomfrey. I'm just thankful I've 
stopped coughing up fur balls."
Ron,Hermione,"We all are, believe me."
Hermione,Harry,"Now. What about the Chamber of 
Secrets? Any new leads?"
Harry,Hermione,Nothing.
Hermione,Harry,"And has it gotten any better? I 
mean... is anyone speaking to you?"
Harry,Hermione,"Neville asked to borrow a tubeworm 
in Potions yesterday. I suppose 
that's something."
Ron,Hermione,"To Miss Granger. Wishing you a 
speedy recovery, from your 
concerned teacher Gilderoy 
Lockhart.' You sleep with this 
under your pillow?"
Hermione,Ron,"Of course not. I don't know how 
that got there. Now go. I still 
have six hundred pages to read in 
Transformation Through the Ages."
Ron,Harry,"I know Hermione's mental, but can 
you believe she falls for that 
smarmy nonsense of Lockhart's?"
Harry,Ron,"Looks like Myrtle's flooded the 
bathroom."
Ron,Harry,Yuck
Moaning Myrtle,Harry,"Come to throw something else at 
me?"
Harry,Moaning Myrtle,"Why would I throw something at 
you?"
Moaning Myrtle,Harry,"Don't ask me. Here I am, minding 
my own business, and someone 
thinks it's funny to throw a book 
at me…"
Ron,Moaning Myrtle,"But it can't hurt if someone 
throws something at you. I mean, 
it'd just go right through you, 
wouldn't it?"
Moaning Myrtle,Ron,"Oh sure! Let's all throw books at 
Myrtle, because she can't feel it! 
Ten points if you can get it 
through her stomach. Fifty points 
if it goes through her head!"
Harry,Moaning Myrtle,Who threw it at you anyway?
Moaning Myrtle,Harry,"I don't know. I didn't see them. 
I was just sitting in the U-bend, 
thinking about death and it fell 
through the top of my head."
Ron,Harry,"Fifty points if you can get it 
through her nose."
Moaning Myrtle,Ron,I HEARD THAT!
Harry,Ron,This is a diary. And it's old…
Ron,Harry,"It's a diary, it's old... and was 
most recently in a toilet, Harry. Are you mad? That could be 
cursed. Dad once told me about a 
book the Ministry confiscated that 
burned the eyes out of anyone who 
tried to read it."
Harry,Ron,I'll take my chances...
Harry,Ginny,"Ahhh! MY EYES! MY EYES!Ginny! I was only joking -- 
Brilliant. Even your sister 
thinks I'm the monster now."
Ron,Harry,"Who doesn't? Tom Marvolo Riddle? Hang on. I 
know that name…Of course! The night I had 
detention... My job was to polish 
the silver in the trophy room. I 
remember because I kept burping 
slugs all over Tom Riddle's 
trophy. I must have wiped slime 
off his name for an hour."
Harry,Ron,That's odd. He never wrote in it.
Hermione,Harry,"Tom Riddle... Hm. And Ron said he 
won an award fifty years ago?"
Harry,Hermione,"Special Services to the School or 
something -- "
Hermione,Harry,Fifty years ago? You're sure?
Harry,Hermione,Yes. Why?
Hermione,Harry,"Don't you remember what Malfoy 
told you? The last time the 
Chamber of Secrets was opened 
was --"
Harry,Hermione,Fifty years ago! That means --
Hermione,Harry,"Tom Riddle was here, at Hogwarts,
when it happened. What if he 
wrote about what he saw? It's 
possible he knew where the Chamber 
was, how to open it, even what 
sort of creature lives in it. If 
so, whoever's behind the attacks 
this time wouldn't want a diary 
like this lying around, would 
they?"
Harry,Hermione,"That's a brilliant theory, 
Hermione. With just one tiny 
little flaw. There's nothing 
written in this diary."
Hermione,Harry,"It might be invisible ink. Aparecium! I don't know, Harry. But I think 
you should be careful with this. 
Something tells me Ron might be 
right. It could be dangerous."
Harry,Hermione,"You don't think I'm dangerous, do 
you, Hermione? I mean, you're not 
scared. Of me."
Hermione,Harry,"I'm scared, Harry. But not of 
you."
Harry,Tom Riddle,"Do... you... know... anything… 
about... the... Chamber... of… 
Secrets? Can... you... tell... me? Excuse me. Could you tell me 
where I am? Hello…"
Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,Riddle.
Tom Riddle,Dumbledore,Professor Dumbledore.
Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,"It's not wise to be wandering 
around this late, Tom."
Tom Riddle,Dumbledore,"Yes, Professor. I suppose I -- I 
just had to see for myself, if…... the rumors were true."
Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,"I'm afraid they are, Tom."
Tom Riddle,Dumbledore,"About the school as well? They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they, Professor?"
Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,"Headmaster Dippet may have no 
choice, I'm afraid."
Tom Riddle,Dumbledore,"Sir? If it all stopped. If the 
person responsible was caught…"
Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,"Is there something you wish to 
tell me, Tom?"
Tom Riddle,Dumbledore,"No, sir. Nothing."
Dumbledore,Tom Riddle,Very well then. Hurry along.
Hagrid,Aragog,"C'mon, Aragog. Gotta get yeh
outta here... C'mon now.. in the
box…"
Tom Riddle,Hagrid,"Evening, Hagrid.I'm going to have to turn you in, 
Hagrid. I don't think you meant 
it to kill anyone --"
Hagrid,Tom Riddle,"No, yeh can't! Yeh don' 
understand!"
Tom Riddle,Hagrid,"Hagrid. The dead girl's parents 
will be here tomorrow. The least 
Hogwarts can do is make sure the 
thing that killed their daughter 
is slaughtered."
Hagrid,Tom Riddle,"It wasn' him! Aragog never'd kill 
no one! Never!"
Tom Riddle,Hagrid,"Monsters don't make good pets, 
Hagrid. Now... stand aside…"
Hagrid,Tom Riddle,Noooooo!
Harry,Ron,"Ron! 
Ron!"
Ron,Harry,What? What's happened...?
Harry,Ron,"It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the 
Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago."
Hermione,Harry,"It can't be Hagrid. It just can't 
be."
Ron,Harry,"We don't even know this Riddle. 
He sounds like a dirty, rotten 
snitch to me."
Harry,Ron,"The monster had killed someone, 
Ron. What would any of us done? "
Hermione,Harry,"Look. Hagrid's our friend. Why 
don't we just go ask him about it?"
Ron,Hermione,"That'd be a cheerful visit. 
Hullo, Hagrid. Tell us, have you 
been setting anything mad and 
hairy loose in the castle lately?"
Hagrid,Harry,"Mad an' hairy? Wouldn' be talkin' 'bou me, now would yeh?"
Harry,Hagrid,No!
Ron,Hagrid,No!
Hermione,Hagrid,No!
Harry,Hagrid,"What's that you've got, Hagrid?"
Hagrid,Harry,"Flesh-Eatin' Slug Repellent. Fer 
the Mandrakes, yeh know. 
Accordin' ter Professor Sprout, 
they still got a bit o' growin' up 
ter do, but once their acne clears 
up, we'll be able to chop 'em up, 
stew 'em, an' get those people in 
the hospital un-Petrified. 'Til 
then, you three best watch 
yerselves, all righ'?"
Neville,Harry,"Harry, I don't know who did it, 
but... you'd better come."
Hermione,Ron,"It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody 
else knows our password. Unless, 
it wasn't a student…"
Ron,Harry,"Well, whoever it was, they were 
looking for something."
Harry,Ron,"And they found it... Tom Riddle's 
diary is gone."
Ron,Ginny,"Hey, Ginny! Going to the match?"
Ron,Harry,"I tell you, she gets weirder and 
weirder by the day…"
Ron,Hermione,No... don't tell me...
Hermione,Harry,"Harry... I think I've just understood 
something! I've got to go to the 
library!"
Harry,Hermione,What do you understand!
Harry,Ron,The library?
Ron,Harry,"That's Hermione. When in doubt, 
go to the library"
Wood,Harry,"Listen up now. We play our game, 
Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance. 
We're stronger, quicker, smarter."
George,Wood,"Not to mention they're dead 
terrified Harry'll Petrify them if 
they fly anywhere near him."
Wood,George,"That, too."
Wood,Professor Mcgonagall,Professor McGonagall --
Professor Mcgonagall,Wood,This match has been cancelled.
Wood,Professor Mcgonagall,"Cancelled! They can't cancel 
Quidditch --"
Professor Mcgonagall,Wood,"Silence, Wood! You will return to 
Gryffindor Tower now. Potter, you 
and I will find Mr. Weasley. 
There's something the both of you 
need to see."
Professor Mcgonagall,Harry,I warn you. This will be a bit of a shock.
Ron,Hermione,Hermione!
Professor Mcgonagall,Ron,"She was found near the library. 
Along with this. Does it mean 
anything to either of you?"
Professor Mcgonagall,Harry,"All students will return to their 
house common rooms by six o'clock 
in the evening. You will be 
escorted to each lesson by a 
teacher. No exceptions.I should tell you all this. 
Unless the culprit behind these 
attacks is caught, it is likely 
that the school will be closed "
Neville,Seamus,"Haven't any of the teachers 
noticed that the Slytherins are 
all safe? Isn't it obvious all 
this stuff's coming from 
Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin, 
the monster of Slytherin -- why 
don't they just chuck all the 
Slytherins out?"
Seamus,Dean,"They can't close Hogwarts. Where 
would we all go?"
Dean,Seamus,"I don't care what anyone says. As 
long as Dumbledore's here, 
Hogwarts will be here."
Harry,Ron,"We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. 
I can't believe it's him. But if 
he did set the monster loose last 
time -- even by accident -- he'll 
know how to get inside the Chamber 
of Secrets. And that's a start."
Ron,Harry,"But you heard McGonagall. We're 
not allowed to leave the tower 
except for class --"
Harry,Ron,"I think it's time to get my Dad's 
old Cloak out again."
Hagrid,Harry,Who's there?
Harry,Hagrid,What's that for?
Hagrid,Harry,"Nothin', nothin'. I've been 
expectin'... Doesn't matter. Sit 
down... I'll make tea…"
Harry,Hagrid,"Are you okay? Hagrid? Did you 
hear about Hermione?"
Hagrid,Harry,"Oh, yea. I heard, all righ'."
Harry,Hagrid,"Look... we have to ask you 
something. Do you know who's 
opened the Chamber of Secrets?"
Hagrid,Harry,C-come in.
Dumbledore,Hagrid,"Good evening, Hagrid."
Ron,Harry,"That's Dad's boss! Cornelius 
Fudge. The Minister of Magic!"
Fudge,Hagrid,"Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad 
business. Had to come. Four 
attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things've gone far enough.
Ministry's got to act."
Hagrid,Dumbledore,"I never... You know I never, 
Professor Dumbledore, sir…"
Dumbledore,Fudge,"I want it understood, Cornelius, 
that Hagrid has my full 
confidence."
Fudge,Dumbledore,"Look, Albus, Hagrid's record's 
against him. I've got to take 
him."
Hagrid,Fudge,"Take me? Where? Not Azkaban 
prison."
Fudge,Hagrid,"For a short stretch only. Not a 
punishment, Hagrid. More a 
precaution. If someone else is 
caught, you'll be released with a 
full apology."
Lucius Malfoy,Fudge,"Already here, Fudge? Good, 
good…"
Hagrid,Lucius Malfoy,"What're you doin' here! Get outta 
my house!"
Lucius Malfoy,Hagrid,"My dear man, please believe me, I 
have no pleasure at all in being 
inside your -- do you call this a 
house? I simply called at the 
school and was told the Headmaster 
was here."
Dumbledore,Lucius Malfoy,"And what exactly did you want with 
me, Lucius?"
Lucius Malfoy,Dumbledore,"Dreadful thing, Dumbledore, but 
the governors feel it's time for 
you to step aside. This is an 
Order of Suspension. You'll find 
all twelve signatures on it. I'm 
afraid we feel you're losing your 
touch. What with all these 
attacks, there'll be no Muggle- 
borns left at Hogwarts. And we 
all know what an awful loss that 
would be."
Fudge,Lucius Malfoy,"Now, see here, Lucius. Dumbledore 
suspended. No, no... last thing 
we want right now... If Dumbledore 
can't stop these attacks... I mean 
to say, who can?"
Lucius Malfoy,Fudge,"That remains to be seen, but as 
all twelve governors have voted --"
Hagrid,Lucius Malfoy,"An' how many did yeh have ter 
threaten before they agreed!"
Lucius Malfoy,Hagrid,"I would advise you not to shout at 
the Azkaban guards like that."
Hagrid,Lucius Malfoy,"Yeh can take Dumbledore! Take him 
away an' the Muggle-borns won' 
stand a chance! There'll be 
killin's next!"
Dumbledore,Hagrid,"Calm yourself, Hagrid!"
Dumbledore,Lucius Malfoy,"If the governors want my removal, 
Lucius, I shall of course step 
aside. However... you will find 
that I will only truly have left 
this school when none here are 
loyal to me. You will also find 
that help will always be given at 
Hogwarts to those who... ask for 
it."
Lucius Malfoy,Dumbledore,"Admirable sentiments. We shall 
all miss your highly individual 
way of running things, Albus, and 
only hope your successor will 
manage to prevent any more, um, 
killin's."
Hagrid,Harry,"If anyone wanted ter find out some 
stuff, all they'd have ter do is 
follow the spiders. That'd lead 
'em right! Tha's all I'm sayin'. "
Ron,Harry,"Hagrid's right. With Dumbledore 
gone, there'll be an attack a day. "
Harry,Ron,Look.. C'mon.
Ron,Harry,What are you doing?
Harry,Ron,"You heard Hagrid. Follow the 
spiders."
Ron,Harry,"They're heading into the Dark 
Forest. Why spiders. Why couldn't it be 
'Follow the butterflies'?"
Harry,Ron,"There's something moving over 
there... something big."
Ron,Harry,"Harry!... Harry, it's our car!"
Harry,Ron,"It's been here all the time! Look 
at it. The Forest has turned it 
wild."
Harry,Ron,"C'mon, we don't want to lose the 
trail."
Ron,Harry,"I don't have a good feeling about 
this, Harry --"
Harry,Ron,Don't panic.
Aragog,Harry,"You do not come from the forest. 
Your hearts beat like... men."
Harry,Aragog,"
                    Yes. We're friends of Hagrid's.
                    And you... you're...
                          
                    ... Aragog, aren't you?"
Aragog,Harry,"Hagrid has never sent men into our
                    hollow before."
Harry,Aragog,"He's in trouble. Up at school,
                    there've been attacks. They think
                    it's Hagrid. They think he's
                    opened the Chamber of Secrets.
                    Like before."
Aragog,Harry,"That's a lie! Hagrid never opend
                    the Chamber of Secrets!"
Harry,Aragog,"But if Hagrid never... that
                    means... you're not the monster."
Aragog,Harry,"The monster was born in the
                    castle. I came from a distant
                    land, in the pocket of a traveler."
Ron,Harry,Harry...
Harry,Ron,Shhh!
Harry,Aragog,"     But if you're not the monster,
                    what did kill that girl fifty
                    years ago?"
Aragog,Harry,"We do not speak of it! It is an
                    ancient creature we spiders fear
                    above all others."
Harry,Aragog,But have you seen it?
Aragog,Harry,"I never saw any part of the castle
             but the cupboard in which Hagrid
             kept me. The girl was discovered
             in a bathroom. When I was
             accused, Hagrid brought me here."
Harry,Ron,"
What!"
Harry,Aragog,"
""Well... thank you. We'll just
             go..."""
Aragog,Harry,"Go? I think not. My sons and
             daughters do not harm Hagrid, on
             my command. But I cannot deny
             them fresh meat when it wanders so
             willingly into our midst.
             Goodbye, friend of Hagrid."
Ron,Harry,"Can we panic now?

Nice knowing you."
Harry,Ron,"Let's go!

THE WINDOWS!   ROLL UP THE WINDOWS!"
Ron,Ron,"
                    I CAN'T! IT'S STUCK!

Thanks for that."
Harry,Ron,"Don't mention it.

""That way! It's the only way out!
                          
Hurry! They're catching up!""

Can you get us in the air?"
Ron,Harry,"Flying gear's jammed!

""Follow the spiders'! Follow the
                    spiders'! If he ever gets out of
                    Azkaban, I'll kill Hagrid. I
                    mean, what was the point of
                    sending us in there? What have we
                    found out?"""
Harry,Ron,"We know one thing. Hagrid never
                    opened the Chamber of Secrets. He
                    was innocent."
Madam Pomfrey,Ron,"There's no point in talking to a
                    petrified person. She won't hear
                    a word you're saying."
Ron,Madam Pomfrey,"We know that, Madam Pomfrey. It's
                    just, well, you see, we thought,
                    maybe, we could... be with her for
                    a bit. She's our... friend, you
                    see, and... even if she can't hear
                    us... I mean, it can't hurt, can
                    it?"
Madam Pomfrey,Ron,"Very well then. But be quick
about it."
Ron,Madam Pomfrey,"You don't think Lockhart could be
             the heir of Slytherin, do you?
                        
                    Right. Forget I said it."
Harry,Hermione,"Wish you were here, Hermione. We
need you. Now more than ever..."
Harry,Ron,"""Of the many fearsome beasts that
                   roam our land, none is more deadly
                   than the Basilisk. Capable of
                   living for hundreds of years,
                   instant death awaits any who meet
                   this giant serpent's eye. Spiders
                   flee before it and only the
                   crowing of the rooster can kill
                   it.'

             Ron! This is it! The monster in
             the Chamber of Secrets is a
             Basilisk. That's why I can hear
             it speak. It's a snake."""
Ron,Harry,"But it kills by looking people in
the eye. Why is it no one's dead?"
Harry,Ron,"Because no one did look it in the
eye. Not directly at least...
   
Colin saw it through his camera.
Justin -- Justin must've seen the
Basilisk through Nearly Headless
Nick! Nick got the full blast of
it, but he's a ghost -- he
couldn't die again...

... And Hermione... had the
mirror! I bet you anything she
was using it to look round
corners, in case it came along."
Ron,Harry,"And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure
she didn't have a camera or a
mirror, Harry."
Harry,Ron," The water... there was water on
                   the floor that night. She only
                   saw the Basilisk's reflection...
                 
                   The crowing of the rooster is
                   fatal to it! That's why Hagrid's
                   roosters were killed! Spiders
                   flee before it! It all fits!"
Ron,Harry,"But how's the Basilisk been
                   getting around? A dirty great
                   snake. Someone would have seen..."
Harry,Ron,Hermione answered that too.
Ron,Harry," Pipes...? It's using the
plumbing."
Harry,Ron,"Remember what Aragog said? About
                   that girl fifty years ago? She
                   died in a bathroom. What if she
                   never left."
Ron,Harry,Moaning Myrtle!
Professor Mcgonagall,Students, All students are to return to their house dormitories at once.
Professor Mcgonagall,Teachers,"    All teachers to the second floor
                   corridor. Immediately.

As you can see, the Heir of
                   Slytherin has left another
                   message. Our worst fear has been
                   realized. A student has been
                   taken by the monster. Into the
                   Chamber itself.
                     
                   I'm afraid we shall have to send
                   the students home. I'm afraid...
                   this is the end of Hogwarts."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Teachers,"So sorry. Dozed off. What have I
missed?"
Snape,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Just the man. A girl has been
                   snatched by the monster, Lockhart.
                   Your moment has come at last."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Snape,My m-moment?
Snape,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Weren't you saying just last night
                   that you've known all along where
                   the entrance to the Chamber of
                   Secrets is?"
Gilderoy Lockhart,Snape,D-did I?   I don't recall...
Professor Mcgonagall,Gilderoy Lockhart,"That settles it. We'll leave it
to you to deal with the monster
Gilderoy. Your skills, after all,
are legend."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Professor Mcgonagall,"V-very well. I'll -- I'll be in
my office, getting -- getting
ready."
Professor Mcgonagall,Teachers,"The rest of us should go and
inform the students what has
happened."
Professor Sprout,Professor Mcgonagall,"Who is it the monster's taken,
Minerva?
"
Professor Mcgonagall,Professor Sprout,Ginny Weasley.
Ron,Harry,"She knew something, Harry. She'd
                   found out something about the
                   Chamber of Secrets. That's why
                   she was taken. I mean, she was --
                   is -- a pure-blood. There can't
                   be any other reason."
Harry,Ron,"C'mon. Let's go see Lockhart. He
                   may be a brainless git, but he's
                   going to try and get into the
                   Chamber. We can tell him what we
                   know..."
Ron,Harry,"Harry. D'you think there's any
             chance at all she's not, you
             know --"
Harry,Ron,"We'll find her, Ron.   Ginny's
                   going to be fine."
Harry,Gilderoy Lockhart,"
Professor, we've got some
information for you --

Are you going somewhere?"
Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry,"Um, well, yes. Urgent call.
Unavoidable. Got to go...
"
Ron,Gilderoy Lockhart,What about my sister?
Gilderoy Lockhart,Ron,"Well, as to that -- most
unfortunate. No one regrets more
than I --"
Ron,Gilderoy Lockhart,"You're the Defense Against the
Dark Arts teacher! You can't go
now!"
Gilderoy Lockhart,Ron,"I must say, when I took the job,
nothing in the job description --"
Harry,Gilderoy Lockhart,"You're running away? After all
that stuff you did in your books?"
Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry,Books can be misleading.
Harry,Gilderoy Lockhart,You wrote them!
Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry,"My dear boy, do use your common
             sense. My books wouldn't have
             sold half as well if people didn't
             think I'd done all those things.
             No one wants to read about some
             ugly old Armenian warlock, even if
             he did save a village from
             werewolves. He'd look dreadful on
             the front cover. No dress sense
at all..."
Harry,Gilderoy Lockhart,"You're a fraud! You've just been
             taking credit for what a load of
             other wizards have done!"
Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry,"Harry, Harry, Harry. There was
             work involved. I had to track
             these people down and ask them
             exactly how they managed to do
             what they did. No, it's not all
             book signings and publicity
             photos. You want fame, you have
             to be prepared for a long, hard
             slog."
Ron,Gilderoy Lockhart,Is there anything you can do?
Gilderoy Lockhart,Ron,"Yes, now that you mention it. I'm
             rather gifted with Memory Charms.
             Otherwise, you see, all those
             wizards would've gone blabbing and
             I'd never have sold another book.
             I'm afraid I'll have to do the
             same to you both, lest you do the
             same."
Harry,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Expelliarmus!

                   Looks like those Dueling Lessons
                   came in handy after all,
                   Professor."
Moaning Myrtle,Harry,"Who's there? Oh...
                   Hello, Harry. What do you want?"
Harry,Moaning Myrtle,To ask you how you died.
Moaning Myrtle,Harry," Oooooh, it was dreadful. It
                   happened right here. In this very
                   cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive
                   Hornby was teasing me about my
                   glasses. I was crying, and then I
                   heard somebody come in."
Harry,Moaning Myrtle,"Who was it, Myrtle?"
Moaning Myrtle,Harry,"I don't know! I was distraught!
                   But they said something funny. A
                   kind of made-up language. And I
                   realized it was a boy speaking.

So I unlocked the door, to tell
him to go away, and... I died."
Harry,Moaning Myrtle,Just like that? How?
Moaning Myrtle,Harry,"No idea. I just remember seeing a
pair of great big yellow eyes.
Over there..."
Harry,Ron,"This is it, Ron. This is the
entrance to the Chamber of
Secrets."
Ron,Harry,"Say something, Harry. Say
something in Parseltongue."
Harry,Ron,Open up.
Ron,Harry,English.
Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry,"Excellent, Harry. Good work.
             Well then. I'll just be going.
             There's no need for me..."
Harry,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Oh, yes there is. You first."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry,"Now, boys.   What good will it do?"
Ron,Gilderoy Lockhart,"A bloody lot of good if it's a
two-hundred-foot drop onto jagged
rocks."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry,"It's really quite filthy down
                   here."
Harry,Gilderoy Lockhart,All right.   Let's go.
Moaning Myrtle,Harry,"Oh, Harry... if you die down
                   there, you're welcome to share my
                   toilet."
Harry,Moaning Myrtle,"Thanks, Myrtle."
Harry,Ron,"Remember. Any sign of movement,
close your eyes straight away."
Ron,Gilderoy Lockhart,What's that?   Up ahead?
Gilderoy Lockhart,Ron,That looks like a... snake.
Harry,Gilderoy Lockhart,Maybe it's asleep.
Ron,Harry,"Bloody hell. Whatever shed this
must be twenty feet long. Or
more.

Heart of a lion, this one."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Ron,"The adventure ends here, boys!
             But don't fret. The world will
             know our story. How I was too
             late to save the girl. How you
             two tragically lost your minds at
             the sight of her mangled body.
             I'll even bind a limited edition
             in this snake skin. Say goodbye
             to your memories.
                    
             Obliviate!"
Harry,Ron,Ron?   Are you okay?
Ron,Harry,"I'm okay. This git's not, though.
                   He got blasted by my wand.

What now?"
Harry,Ron,"Wait here. I'll go on. I'll go
             on and... find Ginny. If I'm not
             back in an hour..."
Ron,Harry," I'll try and shift some of this
             rock. So you can get back
             through. And, Harry --"
Harry,Ron,See you in a bit.
Harry,Ginny,"Ginny!   Please don't be dead.
                            Wake up! Wake up!
Ginny!"
Tom Riddle,Harry,She won't wake.
Harry,Tom Riddle," Tom... Tom Riddle? What d'you
                   mean, she won't wake? She's
                   not..."
Tom Riddle,Harry,She's still alive. But only just.
Harry,Tom Riddle,Are you a ghost?
Tom Riddle,Harry,"
             A memory. Preserved in a diary
for fifty years."
Harry,Tom Riddle,"She's cold as ice. You've got
             to help me, Tom. There's a
             basilisk --
"
Tom Riddle,Harry,It won't come until it's called.
Harry,Tom Riddle,"Give me my wand, Tom."
Tom Riddle,Harry,"You won't be needing it.
"
Harry,Tom Riddle,"Listen, we've got to go!
got to save her!"
Tom Riddle,Harry,"I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry.
You see, as poor Ginny grows
weaker... I grow stronger."
Harry,Tom Riddle,But she's dying!
Tom Riddle,Harry," Yes. I'm afraid so. But then,
             she's been in so much pain, poor
             Ginny. She's been writing to me
             for months, telling me all her
             pitiful worries and woes. Ginny
             poured her soul out to me. I grew
             stronger on a diet of her deepest
             fears, her darkest secrets. I
             grew powerful enough to start
             feeding Ginny a few secrets, to
             start pouring a bit of my soul
             back into her...

Yes, Harry, it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets."
Harry,Tom Riddle,"No... she couldn't -- she
wouldn't."
Tom Riddle,Harry,"It was Ginny who set the Basilisk
on the Mudbloods and the Squib's
cat. Ginny who wrote threatening
messages on the walls.
"
Harry,Tom Riddle,But... Why?...
Tom Riddle,Harry,"Because I told her to. You'll
find that I can be very
persuasive. Not that she knew
what she was doing. She was,
shall we say, in a kind of trance.
Still, the power of the diary
began to scare her and she tried
to dispose of it in the girls'
bathroom. But then, who should
find it... but you. The very
person I was most anxious to meet."
Harry,Tom Riddle,And why did you want to meet me?
Tom Riddle,Harry,"Ginny told me all about you. I
knew I had to talk to you, meet
you if I could. So I decided to
show you my capture of that
brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain
your trust."
Harry,Tom Riddle,"Hagrid's my friend. And you
framed him, didn't you?"
Tom Riddle,Harry,"It was my word against Hagrid's.
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
Hagrid was innocent."
Harry,Tom Riddle,"I'll bet Dumbledore saw right
through you."
Tom Riddle,Harry,"I knew it wouldn't be safe to open
the Chamber again while I was
still at school. So I decided to
leave behind a diary, preserving
my sixteen-year-old self in its
pages, so that one day... I would
be able to lead another to finish
Salazar Slytherin's noble work."
Harry,Tom Riddle,"Well, you haven't finished it this
time. In a few hours Mandrake
Draught will be ready and everyone
who was petrified will be all
right again."
Tom Riddle,Harry,"Haven't I told you, that killing
Mudbloods doesn't matter to me
anymore? For many months now, my
new target has been... you.
                 
             Imagine my disappointment when I
             learned Ginny had stolen the diary
             back from you."
Harry,Tom Riddle,"Ginny stole the diary from my
             room? But why?"
Tom Riddle,Harry,"She was afraid. Afraid you'd
learn how to work the diary.
Afraid I'd tell you just who it
was that had been strangling all
those roosters

. Come now, Harry. Don't look so
             disappointed. Had Ginny succeeded
             in destroying the diary, she would
             have destroyed me. And we
             couldn't be having this little
             talk. And I have so many
             questions for you."
Harry,Tom Riddle,Like what?
Tom Riddle,Harry,"Well, how is it that a baby with
no extraordinary magical talent
managed to defeat the greatest
wizard of all time? How did you
escape with nothing but a scar,
while Lord Voldemort's powers were
destroyed?"
Harry,Tom Riddle,"Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time."
Tom Riddle,Harry,"Voldemort is my past, present and
future."
Harry,Tom Riddle,"You. You're the heir of
                   Slytherin. You're Voldemort?"
Tom Riddle,Harry," Surely you didn't think I would
                   keep my filthy Muggle father's
                   name?

No, I fashioned myself a new name,
                   a name I knew wizards everywhere
                   would one day fear to speak, when
                   I became the greatest sorcerer in
                   the world."
Harry,Tom Riddle," Albus Dumbledore is the greatest
                   sorcerer in the world!"
Tom Riddle,Harry,"Dumbledore's been driven out of
             this castle by the mere memory of
             me."
Harry,Tom Riddle,"He'll never be gone! Not as long
             as those who remain are loyal to
             him!"
Harry,Fawkes,Fawkes.
Tom Riddle,Harry,"
             This is what Dumbledore sends his
             defender! A songbird and an old
             hat!

Speak to me, Slytherin.

 Let's match the powers of Lord
                    Voldemort, Heir of Salazar
                    Slytherin, against the famous
                    Harry Potter, shall we?

Kill him!

Parseltongue won't save you now,
                    Potter. The Basilisk only obeys me."
Harry,Harry,"Don't look. Don't look into its
eyes."
Tom Riddle,Harry,"Fool! Think you're safe!   It can
still hear you!

Yes, Potter. The process is
nearly complete. In a few
minutes, Ginny Weasley will be
dead. And I will cease to be a
memory. Lord Voldemort will
return. Very much... alive.

Remarkable, isn't it? How quickly
             the venom of the Basilisk
             penetrates the body? If you have
             any final words, Potter, you'd
             best speak them now. I'd guess
             you have little more than a minute
             to live.

So ends the famous Harry Potter.
                    On his knees in the Chamber of Secrets. 
Defeated at last by the
             Dark Lord he so unwisely
             challenged. You'll be back with
             your dear Mudblood mother soon,
             Harry...

Funny, isn't it?
The damage a silly little book can do?
Especially in the hands of a silly
little girl.


What are you doing? No. Stop...

No!"
Ginny,Harry,"Harry. It was me! But I swear, I
             didn't mean to... Riddle made me.
             He wrote to me... took me over...
             I didn't even know whose diary it
was. I found it inside my
             cauldron. The day we all went to
             Diagon Alley and... Harry. You're
             hurt..."
Harry,Ginny,"Ginny. You need to get yourself
             out... Follow the chamber...
             You'll find Ron..."
Harry,Fawkes,"You were brilliant, Fawkes. I
just... wasn't quick enough.

Of course. Dumbledore told me.
Phoenix tears have healing powers."
Harry,Ginny,"It's all right, Ginny. It's over.
It's just a memory..."
Ron,Ginny,"Ginny!

You're alive.    I can't believe it."
Ginny,Ron,"I'm going to be expelled, I just
know it!"
Ron,Harry,Remind you of anyone?
Harry,Ron,Where's Lockhart?
Ron,Harry,"His Memory Charm backfired.
Hasn't got a clue who he is. I
keep having to stop him wandering
off. He's a danger to himself."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Ron,"Hello. Odd sort of place, this,
isn't it? Do you live here?"
Ron,Gilderoy Lockhart, No.
Ron,Harry,What's with the bird?
Harry,Ron," I think... I think he's telling me
                    he can take us out of here."
Gilderoy Lockhart,Harry,Amazing!   This is just like magic!
Dumbledore,Harry,"Ingenious. Simply... ingenious.

                    Of course, Tom Riddle was probably
                    the most brilliant student
                    Hogwarts has ever seen. I taught
                    him myself fifty years ago. After
                    he left, I would occasionally hear
                    stories of his activities -- dark
                    rumors -- but after awhile, even
                    the rumors stopped. When he
                    finally resurfaced as Lord
                    Voldemort, most people had
                    completely forgotten the clever
                    Head Boy he'd once been."
Dumbledore,Ron,"Ingenious. Simply... ingenious.

                    the most brilliant student
                    Hogwarts has ever seen. I taught
                    him myself fifty years ago. After
                    he left, I would occasionally hear
                    stories of his activities -- dark
                    rumors -- but after awhile, even
                    the rumors stopped. When he
                    finally resurfaced as Lord
                    Voldemort, most people had
                    completely forgotten the clever
                    Head Boy he'd once been."
Ginny,Dumbledore,"I didn't know whose diary it was,
                    sir. I swear. I found it inside
                    my cauldron.
                 "
Ginny,Harry,"The day we all went to Diagon
Alley."
Ginny,Dumbledore,"  But I understand if... given all
                   the trouble I've caused... if
                   you --"
Dumbledore,Ginny,"Wiser wizards than you have been
                   hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort, Miss
                   Weasley. No, I think you've
                   endured enough. I would suggest a
                   bit of bed rest, however. And
                   perhaps a large mug of hot
                   chocolate. I always find that
                   cheers me up."
Dumbledore,Professor Mcgonagall,"Minerva, will you
                   show Arthur and Molly up to the
                   hospital wing?"
Professor Mcgonagall,Dumbledore,"Certainly, Albus."
Mrs. Weasley,Ginny,"A diary that writes back to you!
                   Honestly, Ginny! What were you
                   thinking? Haven't I always told
                   you? Never trust anything that
                   can think for itself if you can't
                   see where it keeps its brain!
"
Dumbledore,Harry," You two realize, of course, that
                   in the last few hours, you have
                   broken perhaps a dozen school
                   rules?"
Dumbledore,Ron," You two realize, of course, that
                   in the last few hours, you have
                   broken perhaps a dozen school
                   rules?"
Harry,Dumbledore,"Yes, sir."
Ron,Dumbledore,"Yes, sir."
Dumbledore,Ron,"And that there is sufficient
                   evidence to expel you both?
"
Dumbledore,Harry,"And that there is sufficient
                   evidence to expel you both?
"
Harry,Dumbledore,"Yes, sir."
Ron,Dumbledore,"Yes, sir."
Dumbledore,Harry,"Therefore, it seems only
                   fitting...
                          
                   That you both receive Special
                   Awards for Services to the School.
                   And -- let me see -- yes, I think
                   two hundred points apiece, which,
                   I believe, should be more than
                   enough to secure Gryffindor the
                   House Cup."

Harry,Dumbledore,"Thank you, sir."
Ron,Dumbledore,"Thank you, sir."
Dumbledore,Ron,"Now, Mr. Weasley, if you would,
             have an owl deliver these release
             papers to Azkaban. We need our
             gamekeeper back.
"
Dumbledore,Harry," First, Harry, I want to thank you.
             You must have shown me real
             loyalty down in the Chamber.
             Nothing but that could have called
             Fawkes to you. Secondly, I sense
             you're troubled by something. Am
I right?"
Harry,Dumbledore,"It's just, you see, sir, I
                   couldn't help noticing certain
                   things. Certain similarities.
                   Between Tom Riddle and me."
Dumbledore,Harry,"You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,
                   because Lord Voldemort can speak
                   Parseltongue. Unless I'm much
                   mistaken, he transformed some of
                   his own powers to you the night he
                   gave you that scar."
Harry,Dumbledore,"Voldemort put a bit of himself in
                   me?"
Dumbledore,Harry,"Not intentionally, but... yes."
Harry,Dumbledore,"So the Sorting Hat was right.    I
                   should be a Slytherin."
Dumbledore,Harry,"It's true, Harry. You do possess
                   many of the qualities Voldemort
                   himself prizes. Resourcefulness.
                   Determination. A certain
                   disregard for the rules. Yet the
                   Sorting Hat placed you in
                   Gryffindor."
Harry,Dumbledore, Only because I asked it to.
Dumbledore,Harry,"Exactly. Which makes you very
                   different from Voldemort. It's
                   not our abilities that show what
                   we truly are, Harry. It's our
                   choices.
                      
                   If you want proof that you belong
                   in Gryffindor, Harry, I suggest
                   you look more closely at this."
Harry,Dumbledore,Godric Gryffindor.'
Dumbledore,Harry," Only a true Gryffindor could have
                   pulled that out of the Hat.
"
Harry,Dobby,"Dobby! This is your Master? The
family you serve is the Malfoys!"
Lucius Malfoy,Harry,"Out of my way, Potter."
Lucius Malfoy,Dumbledore,             So! You've returned!
Dumbledore,Lucius Malfoy,"Yes. When the governors heard
             that Arthur Weasley's daughter had
             been taken into the Chamber, they
             saw fit to summon me back.
      
             Curiously, several of them seemed
             under the impression that you
             would curse their families if they
             didn't agree to suspend me in the
             first place, Lucius.
"
Lucius Malfoy,Dumbledore,"From the beginning, my only
             concern has been the welfare of
             this school and its students.
             I assume the culprit has been
             identified."
Dumbledore,Lucius Malfoy,"Oh yes. It was Voldemort. Only
             this time, he chose to act through
             someone else. By means of...
             this.

Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter
             discovered it.
           
             One only hopes that no more of
             Lord Voldemort's old school things
             find their way into innocent
             hands. The consequences for the
             one responsible could be...
             severe."
Lucius Malfoy,Dobby,"Come, Dobby. We're leaving."
Harry,Lucius Malfoy,"Sir? I wonder if I could have
that.

Mr. Malfoy!    I have something of
yours."
Lucius Malfoy,Harry,"Mine? I don't know what you're
                    talking about."
Harry,Lucius Malfoy,"I think you do, sir. I think you
                    slipped it into Ginny Weasley's
                    cauldron that day in Diagon Alley."
Lucius Malfoy,Harry,Prove it!
Lucius Malfoy,Dobby,"Dobby!  Dobby, come!"
Dobby,Lucius Malfoy,"Master has given Dobby a sock.
Master has presented Dobby with
clothes. Dobby is... free!"
Lucius Malfoy,Dobby,What? I didn't --
Lucius Malfoy,Harry,You've lost me my servant!
Dobby,Lucius Malfoy,You shall not harm Harry Potter!
Lucius Malfoy,Harry,"Mark my words, Harry Potter.
             You'll meet the same sticky end as
             your parents one of these days.
             They were meddlesome fools too."
Dobby,Harry,"Harry Potter freed Dobby!
             How can Dobby ever repay him?"
Harry,Dobby,Just promise me something.
Dobby,Harry,"Anything, sir."
Harry,Dobby,Never try to save my life again.
Hermione,Harry,You solved it! You solved it!
Harry,Hermione,With loads of help from you.
Ron,Hermione,"Welcome back, Hermione."
Dumbledore,Teachers,"Before we begin our feast, let's
             give a round of applause to
             Professor Sprout and Madame
             Pomfrey, whose Mandrake Juice has
             been successfully administered to
             all those who had been petrified."
Dumbledore,Students,"             Also, in the wake of recent
             events, as a school treat, all
             exams have been cancelled."
Hermione,Hermione,"Oh, no!"
Hagrid,Harry,"Sorry I'm late. The owl deliverin'
             my release papers got all lost 'n
             confused. Some ruddy bird named
             Errol.

I jus' want to say... that if it
